# Config for linting git commit messages
# --------------------------------------
#
# gitlint's default validations are based on "well-known community standards"
# including:

#
# As such, overrides here are kept to an absolute minimum.
# But a few are useful...

#
# Adding a couple of custom rules - see the comments there for more detail

#
# Adding the list of standard types (e.g. "feat", "fix", etc.) for titles from
#  https://pages.github.ibm.com/the-playbook/developer-guide/delivering-code-command-line/#type
#  to make sure that we stick to the list in the playbook

# Making the email regex a little more IBM-specific to help people who accidentally
#  leave personal email addresses like bob.smith@gmail.com in their git config
